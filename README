SUMMARY
-------

This project was created after I noticed, that on

  http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generische_Programmierung

the link to my old project does not work anymore.  As I entered the
worklife and therefore just finished university -- leaving behind all
my ancient code on the server.

INSTALL
-------

To install this example project, just
  make
the project.

There happens to exist also a
  make clean
which clean up the directory of all object files and executables.
